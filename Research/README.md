## 🏆 Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: All experiments are tracked in git
2. **Reproducibility**: Include random seeds and environment details
3. **Comparison**: Always compare against baseline
4. **Documentation**: Record both successes and failures
5. **Metrics**: Use consistent evaluation metrics across experiments
